        "abstract": "While motor interaction between a robot and a human, or between humans, has important implications for society as well as promising applications, little research has been devoted to its investigation. In particular, it is important to understand the different ways two agents can interact and generate suitable interactive behaviors. Towards this end, this paper introduces a framework for the description and implementation of interactive behaviors of two agents performing a joint motor task. A taxonomy of interactive behaviors is introduced, which can classify tasks and cost functions that represent the way each agent interacts. The role of an agent interacting during a motor task can be directly explained from the cost function this agent is minimizing and the task constraints. The novel framework is used to interpret and classify previous works on human-robot motor interaction. Its implementation power is demonstrated by simulating representative interactions of two humans. It also enables us to interpret and explain the role distribution and switching between roles when performing joint motor tasks.",

        "abstract": "This paper summarizes findings on the growing field of role assignment policies for human\u2013robot motor interaction. This topic has been investigated by researchers in the psychological theory of joint action, in human intention detection, force control, human\u2013human physical interaction, as well as roboticists interested in developing robots with capabilities for efficient motor interaction with humans. Our goal is to promote fruitful interaction between these distinct communities by: (i) examining the role assignment policies for human\u2013robot joint motor action in experimental psychology and robotics studies, and (ii) informing researchers in human\u2013human interaction on existing work in the robotic field. After an overview of roles assignment in current robotic assistants, this paper examines key results about shared control between a robot and a human performing interactive motor tasks. Research on motor interaction between two humans has inspired recent developments that may extend the use of robots to applications requiring continuous mechanical interaction with humans.",

The intention recognition process is inspired by the neural mechanism of the mirror neurons in macaque monkey brain. We try to renovate a standard neural network with parametric biases as a reference model to imitate between sensory-motor data pair. The imitation process is primarily directed toward reproducing the goals of observed actions rather than the exact action trajectories. Several experiments and their results show that the proposed model allows to develop useful robotic application for human\u2013robot interaction system application.",

        "abstract": "In human-computer collaboration involving haptics, a key issue that remains to be solved is to establish an intuitive communication between the partners. Even though computers are widely used to aid human operators in teleoperation, guidance, and training, because they lack the adaptability, versatility, and awareness of a human, their ability to improve efficiency and effectiveness in dynamic tasks is limited. We suggest that the communication between a human and a computer can be improved if it involves a decision-making process in which the computer is programmed to infer the intentions of the human operator and dynamically adjust the control levels of the interacting parties to facilitate a more intuitive interaction setup. In this paper, we investigate the utility of such a dynamic role exchange mechanism, where partners negotiate through the haptic channel to trade their control levels on a collaborative task. We examine the energy consumption, the work done on the manipulated object, and the joint efficiency in addition to the task performance. We show that when compared to an equal control condition, a role exchange mechanism improves task performance and the joint efficiency of the partners. We also show that augmenting the system with additional informative visual and vibrotactile cues, which are used to display the state of interaction, allows the users to become aware of the underlying role exchange mechanism and utilize it in favor of the task. These cues also improve the user's sense of interaction and reinforce his/her belief that the computer aids with the execution of the task.",

        "abstract": "The last decades have seen a surge of robots working in contact with humans. However, until now these contact robots have made little use of the opportunities offered by physical interaction and lack a systematic methodology to produce versatile behaviours. Here, we develop an interactive robot controller able to understand the control strategy of the human user and react optimally to their movements. We demonstrate that combining an observer with a differential game theory controller can induce a stable interaction between the two partners, precisely identify each other\u2019s control law, and allow them to successfully perform the task with minimum effort. Simulations and experiments with human subjects demonstrate these properties and illustrate how this controller can induce different representative interaction strategies. Robots need to estimate and adapt to human behaviour, especially when human dynamics change over time. Now adaptive game theory controllers can help robots adapt to human behaviour in a reaching task.",

        "abstract": "Interaction control presents opportunities for contact robots physically interacting with their human user, such as assistance targeted to each human user, communication of goals to enable effective teamwork, and task-directed motion resistance in physical training and rehabilitation contexts. Here we review the burgeoning field of interaction control in the control theory and machine learning communities, by analysing the exchange of haptic information between the robot and its human user, and how they share the task effort. We first review the estimation and learning methods to predict the human user intent with the large uncertainty, variability and noise and limited observation of human motion. Based on this motion intent core, typical interaction control strategies are described using a homotopy of shared control parameters. Recent methods of haptic communication and game theory are then presented to consider the co-adaptation of human and robot control and yield versatile interactive control as observed between humans. Finally, the limitations of the presented state of the art are discussed and directions for future research are outlined.",

        "abstract": "Since the strict separation of working spaces of humans and robots has experienced a softening due to recent robotics research achievements, close interaction of humans and robots comes rapidly into reach. In this context, physical human\u2013robot interaction raises a number of questions regarding a desired intuitive robot behavior. The continuous bilateral information and energy exchange requires an appropriate continuous robot feedback. Investigating a cooperative manipulation task, the desired behavior is a combination of an urge to fulfill the task, a smooth instant reactive behavior to human force inputs and an assignment of the task effort to the cooperating agents. In this paper, a formal analysis of human\u2013robot cooperative load transport is presented. Three different possibilities for the assignment of task effort are proposed. Two proposed dynamic role exchange mechanisms adjust the robot\u2019s urge to complete the task based on the human feedback. For comparison, a static role allocation strategy not relying on the human agreement feedback is investigated as well. All three role allocation mechanisms are evaluated in a user study that involves large-scale kinesthetic interaction and full-body human motion. Results show tradeoffs between subjective and objective performance measures stating a clear objective advantage of the proposed dynamic role allocation scheme.",

        "abstract": "In this article, we describe two techniques to enable haptic-guided teleoperation using 7-DoF cobot arms as master and slave devices. A shortcoming of using cobots as master-slave systems is the lack of force feedback at the master side. However, recent developments in cobot technologies have brought in affordable, flexible, and safe torque-controlled robot arms, which can be programmed to generate force feedback to mimic the operation of a haptic device. In this article, we use two Franka Emika Panda robot arms as a twin master-slave system to enable haptic-guided teleoperation. We propose a two layer mechanism to implement force feedback due to 1) object interactions in the slave workspace, and 2) virtual forces, e.g. those that can repel from static obstacles in the remote environment or provide task-related guidance forces. We present two different approaches for force rendering and conduct an experimental study to evaluate the performance and usability of these approaches in comparison to teleoperation without haptic guidance. Our results indicate that the proposed joint torque coupling method for rendering task forces improves energy requirements during haptic guided telemanipulation, providing realistic force feedback by accurately matching the slave torque readings at the master side.",

        "abstract": "The increasing adoption of robot systems in industrial settings and teaming with humans have led to a growing interest in human-robot interaction (HRI) research. While many robots use sensors to avoid harming humans, they cannot elaborate on human actions or intentions, making them passive reactors rather than interactive collaborators. Intention-based systems can determine human motives and predict future movements, but their closer interaction with humans raises concerns about trust. This scoping review provides an overview of sensors, algorithms, and examines the trust aspect of intention-based systems in HRI scenarios. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and IEEE Xplore databases to identify studies related to the forementioned topics of intention-based systems in HRI. Results from each study were summarized and categorized according to different intention types, representing various designs. The literature shows a range of sensors and algorithms used to identify intentions, each with their own advantages and disadvantages in different scenarios. However, trust of intention-based systems is not well studied. Although some research in AI and robotics can be applied to intention-based systems, their unique characteristics warrant further study to maximize collaboration performance. This review highlights the need for more research on the trust aspects of intention-based systems to better understand and optimize their role in human-robot interactions, at the same time establishes a foundation for future research in sensor and algorithm designs for intention-based systems.",

N-player linear quadratic differential game theory is used to describe the system under study. N-player differential game theory can not be used directly in actual scenerie, since the robot cannot know humans\u2019 control objectives in advance. In order to let the robot know humans\u2019 control objectives, the paper presents an online estimation method to identify unknown humans\u2019 control objectives based on the recursive least squares algorithm. The Nash equilibrium solution of human-robot-human interaction is obtained by solving the coupled Riccati equation. Adaptive optimal control can be achieved during the human-robot-human physical interaction. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by rigorous theoretical analysis and simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed controller can achieve adaptive optimal control during the interaction between the robot and two humans.
